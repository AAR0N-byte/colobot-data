msgid "In CBOT, we measure angles by using units called degrees. So, the angle of 0 degrees means two lines overlapping each other, 90 degrees is the angle of the square, and 35 degrees can be for example one of the angles of a triangle. Angles can be between 0 and 360 degrees, where 360 means full rotation, so it's basically the same as 0 degrees."

msgid "You can rotate your robot using the instruction <token/><c/><a cbot/turn>turn();</a>|n;<norm/>, but instead of specifying a distance like in the <token/><c/><a cbot/move>move();</a><n/><norm/> instruction, you must specify an angle (distance wouldn't make much sense for turning, don't you think?). This doesn't mean you must use some special notation, for CBOT number are just numbers, but a number like <code>5</code> means something different for <token/><c/><a cbot/move>move();</a>|n;<norm/> and <token/><c/><a cbot/turn>turn();</a><n/><norm/>."

msgid "Imagine that you are looking at a robot from above and there is a line symbolizing the direction the robot's headed. Then there is a second line symbolizing the direction that you want your robot to head. Both lines meet in the center of the robot, so the robot is in this case the vertex. The angle between the two lines is what you need to pass to the <token/><c/><a cbot/turn>turn();</a><n/><norm/> function. The robot will turn anti-clockwise. Note that the direction of the robot has changed, so if you will turn 90 degrees twice, then your robot will be rotated 180 degrees relative to its starting rotation."

msgid "How do you figure out the angle? It depends on the situation. In simple programs, like in this chapter, the angles are rather simple and you can \"guess\" them. The above picture might be helpful with that. You should remember the most important values like <code>0</code>, <code>90</code>, <code>180</code> and <code>360</code>. Test some angles in this exercise if you want."
