\b;What Have You Already Done
You did it! You wrote your own program and learned about negative parameters you can pass to the \token;\c;\l;move();\u cbot/move;\n;\norm; \l;function\u cbot/function; all by yourself! You don't even have to remember that function, because you can always look it up in the documentation. Never be ashamed to use documentation, especially in this course (we won't always be telling you all the details to solve a problem).

By the way, the engineers weren't very pleased when they heard about the sleeping bot, it's in big trouble right now! That'll show everyone that we do not tolerate sleeping in classes, especially sleeping robots. That's a bug in some models presumably.

\b;What Is an Angle?
Time for a little revision from school. You need to know how angles work in order to steer your robots.

An angle is created by two lines meeting each other. We call the lines -- sides of the angle, and the point -- a vertex.

In CBOT, we measure angles by using units called degrees. The angle of 0 degrees means two lines overlapping each other, 90 degrees is the inside angle between two sides of a square, and 35 degrees can be for example one of the three angles of a triangle. Different angles can be anything between 0 and 360 degrees, where 360 means full rotation, so it's basically the same as 0 degrees. The measure of an angle doesn't need to be an integer, it can be any real number like \c;64.65329\n;.

\b;How to Turn?
You can rotate your robot using the instruction \token;\c;\l;turn();\u cbot/turn;\n;\norm;, but instead of specifying a distance like in the \token;\c;\l;move();\u cbot/move;\n;\norm; instruction, you must specify an angle (distance wouldn't make much sense for turning, don't you think?). This doesn't mean you must use some special notation, for CBOT numbers are just numbers. However, a number like \c;5\n; means something different for \token;\c;\l;move();\u cbot/move;\n;\norm; and \token;\c;\l;turn();\u cbot/turn;\n;\norm;. The meaning of a symbol in programming sometimes depends on the context in which it is used.

Imagine that you are looking at a robot from above and there is a line symbolizing the direction the robot's headed. Then there is a second line symbolizing the direction that you want your robot to head. Both lines meet in the center of the robot, so the robot is in this case the vertex. The angle between the two lines is what you need to pass to the \token;\c;\l;turn();\u cbot/turn;\n;\norm; function. The robot will turn anti-clockwise. Note that the direction of the robot has changed, so if you turn 90 degrees twice, then your robot is rotated 180 degrees relative to its starting rotation.

How do you figure out the angle? It depends on the situation. In simple programs, like in this chapter, the angles are rather simple and you can "guess" them. The above picture might be helpful with that. You should remember the most important values like \c;0\n;, \c;90\n;, \c;180\n; and \c;360\n;. Test some angles in this exercise if you want.

\b;Task
We placed some \l;waypoints\u object\waypoint; on the ground. Together with the \l;start area\u object/start; they could form a square of side 20 meters. Get to all of them with your \l;robot\u object/bottr; and return to your starting position.

\t;Tip
You can run a program multiple times in an exercise. You can also just write a longer program that doesn't need to be started more than once.
