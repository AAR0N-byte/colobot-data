\b;Introductory exercise
This is your first exercise, where you will learn how to program bots available for your disposition during the future missions. We created a programming language specifically for our bots, namely \c;CBOT\n;. If you already know some other popular languages like Java or C++, you will soon find out that CBOT is similar to them in many ways.

Your \c;SatCom communicator\n; always provides you with useful informations about your current situation. You are reading the main page right now. It is changing between missions (including also exercises), so it should be your habit to always read it before taking any significant action.

There is another page, or rather a set of pages, called \c;CBOT programming book\n;. During these exercises, it will be your greatest friend. You can open it by clicking on the book \button 188; button or on links, which occasionally you may come across with. For example, \l;here\u cbot;. You can always come back to the main page by clicking on the top \button 185; button or return to previously visited page by clicking on the left arrow \button 55; buttton. You can learn more about navigating in SatCom \l;here\u navig;.

\b;Brief
You have probably already noticed that you are being attacked by two \l;aliens\u object\ant;. Do not panic. They are not real and will not hurt you unless you accidentaly come too close to their range of fire. Currently, they should be focused on the bot. It is a \l;wheeled shooter\u object\botfr;, a robot built in order to defend human beings against any harmful threat, especially aliens. Bots can be controlled in two ways: by a program or by remote control. The latter is not possible during exercises, so do not even try. It will, however, be available to you during missions.

In theory, you can solve most problems by controlling robots by yourself, but programming is a much better way of doing things if you know how to use this tool properly. We used here the word "tool", because that is what programming really is - a hammer to build a house, a knife to cut the food, and so on. It exists because it makes our lifes easier and, sometimes, makes some tasks even possible or just gives us faster and better solutions. For example, a human can add two to two, but computer can add 123456789 to 6473892123 with ease.

There are a lot of programming languages. It is often a hard task to find the one that will get the job done with least time, effort and best possible result. You do not write webpages in C++ like you do not use a hammer to cut a bread. We wanted to have a language similar to the ones that most programmers already know and at the same time as simple as possible, in order to let our employees working in the field write working and useful programs in no time. With CBOT you can focus on logic (what needs to be done) instead of a lot of technical stuff, like moving a part of the robot arm. We call CBOT a \c;high-level\n; programming language, like C++ and Java for example, because it is (in most cases) not controlling directly physical parts of the robot. For that, there are other programming languages, for example Assembler, but we will not bother with anything except CBOT in these exercises.

\t;Your job
We have already written a program for this exercise. All you need to do is run it. Select the bot \button 143; and choose the "Solution" program from the list. Then, click on the orange arrow \button 21; button in order to run it. After that, just watch how the bot destroys the aliens and notice how programming is powerful. And it is just the beginning! We will do a lot of interesting stuff in the next exercises.

If you feel confident, you can try to open the source code in the editor and analyse it or even modify it and write your own. We will learn all these and more in the next exercise.
