msgid "This is your first exercise, where you will learn how to program bots available for your disposition during the future missions. We created a programming language specifically for our bots, namely <code>CBOT</code>. If you already know some other popular languages like Java or C++, you will soon find out that CBOT is similar to them in many ways."

msgid "In theory, you can solve most problems by controlling robots by yourself, but programming is a much better way of doing things if you know how to use this tool properly. We used here the word \"tool\", because that is what programming really is - a hammer to build a house, a knife to cut the food, and so on. It exists because it makes our lifes easier and, sometimes, makes some tasks even possible or just gives us faster and better solutions. For example, a human can add two to two, but computer can add 123456789 to 6473892123 with ease."

msgid "There are a lot of programming languages. It is often a hard task to find the one that will get the job done with least time, affort and best possible result. You do not write webpages in C++ like you do not use a hammer to cut a bread. We wanted to have a language similar to the ones that most programmers already know and at the same time as simple as possible, in order to let our employees working in the field write working and useful programs in no time. With CBOT you can focus on logic (what needs to be done) instead of a lot of technical stuff, like moving a part of the robot arm. We call CBOT a <code>high-level</code> programming language, like C++ and Java for example, because it is (in most cases) not controlling directly physical parts of the robot. For that, there are other programming languages, for example Assembler, but we will not bother with anything except CBOT in these exercises."
