msgid "Welcome to Colobot: Gold Edition, a real-time strategy game where you save the world by programming robots! This is one of the many game modes available, namely Programming Course or just Exercises. Here you will not only gain fundamental and advanced knowledge about bot programming but also learn to think like a programmer, maybe even like a computer scientist. After this course, you should be able to program your way through the game in the other game modes and also get an unfair advantage of experience when you decide to learn the real-world programming. All you have to do is to beat this game. Isn't that amazing?"

In fact, by using programming you can get even better and more precise results since computers don't make mistakes like humans do (well, they do, but it's probably user/programmer/project manager's fault). They do exactly what they are said to do, without second thoughts. This makes them much more efficient, for example, try to calculate 56783.5678 * 1455.6 in your mind in a fraction of a second. Impossible, right? Not for a computer."

With proper algorithms computers can sort enormous chunks of data, find the shortest paths, build other robots, make us a coffee, basically they can do a lot of what we would want them to do. We \"only\" need to know a good algorithm and write it in a form understandable by computer. The algorithm creation is actually the hardest part, there are a lot of computer scientists trying to come up with the best solutions, or to prove that an efficient solution for particular problems doesn't even exist. We'll cover some of the popular algorithmic problems in later chapters."

Problem solving is the essence of programming, this is where most of the fun lies. The goal is to see your program finally working, to understand  w h y  it's working, to make someone's (your) life easier. How to get alphabetically sorted list of all shop customers in a reasonable amount of time? How to get to New York from Warsaw in the shortest time possible? What is the most optimal way you can pack for your travel? How to shoot invading aliens while flying? These are only few examples of problems you can solve by programming!"

msgid "So, how exactly can you talk with a computer? Obviously, you can't just say \"build me a base\" and expect the computer to understand you. Natural language is unnatural for machines. It's too sophisticated and ambiguous. Even humans can't understand each other from time to time! Try to explain to a machine that an idiom like \"keep this under your hat\" doesn't mean that the machine should literally put a thing under its gorgeous hat. You'll fail miserably. Machines need precise and determined sequence of instructions. How is the \"keep\" action defined? What is \"this\"? What does \"under\" mean? Where is \"your hat\"? Only after you precisely define all the words and grammar, a computer can understand a sentence using those definitions and try to execute it."

Simple concept, yet it still doesn't make the human-machine communication very easy. Back in the day, there was no place to type those long sequences of zeroes and ones. Programmers needed to plug in or out some cables, pull some levers, and that kind of stuff. If one made a mistake, the whole sequence had to be repeated again! In the picture below you can see the first world's computer, ENIAC."

msgid "Today, we use so called programming languages. They are formal, relatively simple languages, in some ways similar to the mathematical notation, although usually with far fewer odd symbols scaring outsiders. Programming languages are connecting the low-level computer language with the natural human language. When you write a program in a programming language, it is understandable by a human being (knowing the language) and at the same time it can be translated to a language understandable by a computer. The process of translating source code into machine code is called compilation, and is done by so called compilers."

msgid "CBOT is a high-level language, which is the opposite of a low-level language. Low-level languages are close to machine, for example, they give you almost direct access to memory and processor instructions. Programs written in a low-level language are usually error-prone, less multiplatform and their source code is less readable. That's why most programmers use high-level languages which provide layers of abstraction, so for example, a programmer doesn't have to think about memory management and can focus more on the problem at hand."
