msgid "In order to create <code>source code</code>, you need to use a special tool - any plain text editor (like Notepad, not like Wordpad). Imagine you open a simple text editor and write <code>\"tell me what is 2+2\"</code>. You could say it is an <code>algorithm</code>, a very simple one, but an algorithm. But you should not say that this is a computer program. Computers do not understand natural language and it is very hard to make them understand it. Human languages, like English or Polish, are not very precise and are complicated. For example, a person would understand if someone said to him/her \"keep this under your hat\" as \"do not tell anyone this\", but a computer would have problems with that idiom and probably would not understand what that sentence really mean. It would interpret it as \"keep this under your hat\" and probably it would show an error with a message saying \"'this' is an information, it can't be put under a hat as it is not a physical thing!\". Sometimes even a person can't understand another person, so how can we tell a computer what to do?"

msgid "That is why programming languages were created. They are as precise as formal mathematics and (usually) readable for human. But there is another problem. Computers still do not understand them, because they are still a plain text. There is no difference for a computer if in a text file it reads <code>\"tell me what is 2+2\"</code> or <c/>\"message(2+2);\"<n/>. \"What? What was the point then?!\", you might think. The point is, because of brutal precision of these languages, the algorithms written in them actually <code>can</code> be translated to a machine language, to ones and zeroes (one as electric current flows, and zero as it does not flow). The more high-level language, the more readable it is for human. The more low-level language, the more closer it is to the machine language."

Technically, we could make it that way and some languages are built that way, but very often compilers ignore all whitespaces (invisible characters, like a space, tabulator or new line) on purpose. Arguably, it makes programs more readable and easier to write. You may have a different opinion about it, but that's how it works in many languages, including CBOT. Anyway, because of ignoring all whitespaces, these languages must have some way to distinguish each statement from each other. In CBOT (like in Java or C++ for example), it is done by using semicolons and curly braces."
