\b;What you already know
In the last exercise you (hopefully) read and learned about programming in general. You know that programming solves problems, automates repetitive tasks and you can tell the difference between a low-level and high-level language. You also know what is a compiler and an algorithm, so you probably already are wiser than some of your friends and family! And that's just the beginning!

You had to beat the previous exercise by \l;manually\u command; (oh, no!) controlling the astronaut and the robot. Goosebumps! Never ever you'll have to do that again, at least in this course. Altough you can't program the astronaut (unfortunately), you won't need to do that anyway. Robots are usually sufficient.

(If you did program your way through, then either you already know how to program or you cheated (reading a guide on the Internet counts as cheating!). Otherwise... That's really impressive! Keep up the good job!)

\t;Note
Note that from this point on the manual control of the robots we provide in this course is disabled.

\b;Unforeseen consequences
\c;
\tab;>>> WARNING! Enemy signatures detected nearby!
\tab;>>> WARNING! Enemy type: \l;AlienAnt\u object/ant;.
\tab;>>> WARNING! Enemies seem to be approaching this position!
\tab;>>> Searching for solutions...
\tab;>>> Solution found.
\tab;>>> Uploading SpecializedAntiAlienDefenseProgram to \l;WheeledShooter\u object/botfr;...
\tab;>>> Do not close the Sattelite Communicator before the uploading is complete!
\n;
What? What's that about? It seems that you're surrounded by a l i e n s! Don't worry! It will take them some time to get here and you have WheeledShooter with you, fortunately, as \l;the astronauts\u object/human; are not allowed to have weapons (for some reason...). Let's take that moment to learn how to run the program that is being uploaded to your Shooter.

\b;How to run a program
After you close your \button 63; (do not do that right now!) and select your robot (better do it fast after the upload is complete) you'll see a few buttons and a list in the lower left corner of the screen. Every robot can have more than one program on its hard disk, but can only run one of them at a time. You can select a program by clicking on the position on the list with the \key;left mouse button\norm;.

Below the list there are buttons for managing the list, for example adding \button 24; and deleting \button 25; a program from the list. We don't have time and need right now to learn about those, but it should be fairly intuitive.

On the right side of the list you'll find two big buttons. \button 22; opens the CBOT editor which we will discuss soon enough. Now, \button 21; is what we're looking for. It runs the program selected on the list.
\c;
\tab;>>> CAUTION! Enemies are close!
\tab;>>> Uploading of the SpecializedAntiAlienDefenseProgram completed.
\tab;>>> It can be run from the 1. position on the list.
\tab;>>> Thanks for choosing Terranova Communications and have a nice day!
\n;
Just in time!

\b;Task
Kill all the surrounding aliens and survive the ambush. Running away is prohibited under the threat of being fired and losing all the fun.

\t;Tip
If something goes wrong, you can reset the whole level by pressing \button 9; while selecting a robot. Do that b e f o r e it is destroyed!
