\b;The Time Has Come
It's time to test your skill and knowledge in this last exercise of this chapter. You may think you are not ready, but if you've beaten the previous exercises, you'll never be more ready (unless you are above the level of this chapter). Programmers can't know everything, but they still take challenges with confidence that they'll be able to figure them out sooner or later.

You know how to move. You know how to turn. That's all you need for this exam. It's not even a real exam, so you have all the time in the world. Remember, a wise man once said that there are no hard problems, only time-consuming ones.

Good luck, rookie! We've prepared a surprise for you for after the exam, involving... shooting! Oh, that's no longer a surprise since we've told you... It'll be fun either way! Good luck once again!

\b;CBOT Driving License Exam
Using only \token;\c;\l;move();\u cbot/move;\n;\norm;, \token;\c;\l;turn();\u cbot/turn;\n;\norm; and \token;\c;\l;sqrt();\u cbot/sqrt;\n;\norm; instructions, guide your robot to the \l;goal area\u object/goal; through the labyrinth shown on the picture below.

(Psst, hey, I'd like to give you a hint. Oh, my! By the looks of the labyrinth, you'll need a long program to get through! Okay, listen, you don't necessarily need to know how exactly and why something works in order to use it, so don't be scared when you see stuff you've never seen before, especially on exams. It's probably not that important to know the details, only what it is and how you can (need to) use it. You can figure it out! Also, remember that you always have the documentation available.)
