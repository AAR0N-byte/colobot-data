You may think you are not ready, but if you've beaten the previous exercises, you'll never be more ready (unless you are above the level of this chapter). Programmers can't know everything, but they still take challenges with confidence that they'll be able to figure them out sooner or later."

Okay, listen, you don't necessarily need to know how exactly and why something works in order to use it, so don't be scared when you see stuff you've never seen before, especially on exams. It's probably not that important to know the details, only what it is and how you can (need to) use it. You can figure it out! Also, remember that you always have the documentation available.)"
