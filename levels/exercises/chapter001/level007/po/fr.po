The distance between the bot and the target is given by <code><a cbot|dist>distance</a>(position, item.position)</code>. The range of a fireball cannon is 40 meters. In order to get close enough, the bot must move forward <code><a cbot|dist>distance</a>(position, item.position)-40</code> meters. The following line will do this:"
