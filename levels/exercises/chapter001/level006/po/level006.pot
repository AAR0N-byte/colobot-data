msgid "Many programmers should feel at least a little bit comfortably with math up to high school level. This should be fairly enough to get a lot of stuff done. Most of the school material might not be necessary, but better to know more than less, don't you think? You never know when being able to solve a quadratic equation might come in handy. If you aren't a high school graduate yet, don't worry. You still have time, just don't take math classes too lightly. Treat them at least like a training of logical and abstract thinking, of being able to solve problems, which is obviously important in programming."

msgid "You might even want to make a step further. In universities they teach you some really hard high-level math, yet Computer Science wouldn't exist without it. Algorithms are complicated and it is important for a computer scientist to be able to tell how long an algorithm will be running, to prove if it is correct or to just get an idea how to solve a hard problem, like finding the shortest path (which is not that trivial as you might think)."

msgid "We don't want to scare you. You can be a decent programmer without doing more complicated calculations than addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. In this course though, we will try to teach you some math when it's necessary. This is not a math course, but you'll see that math has many applications in programming. Especially geometry and trigonometry is useful in Colobot. The more you know, the better. You might be surprised how math synergizes well with programming."

msgid "Math is especially needed in graphics-related software, video games, robotics, cryptography and so on. You can't know physics without math. Even when you are creating a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) or a website, you might need to do some simple calculations in order to get a GUI element, like a button, properly positioned. Most importantly, you won't get away from math if you want to create your SuperEfficientAndEffectiveAlienKillingProgram, although a simpler program might be sufficient for you, so yeah, the answer to the question is ambigous indeed."
