\b;You Passed
Congratulations!

You passed the exam! We're so proud of you! See what you've learned in this chapter:
* You know what is an algorithm, program, source code, programming language and compiler.
* You can distinguish high-level languages from low-level languages.
* You can prove why programming is useful.
* You know how to control the game.
* You know what is an IDE and how to use it.
* You know the basic structure of a CBOT program.
* You can write proper identifiers.
* You know how to define the main function.
* You know what is a block, an instruction, a keyword, a type, a parameter, a call of a function, a statement, a whitespace.
* You can use the \token;\c;\l;move();\u cbot/move;\n;\norm; instruction.
* You can use the \token;\c;\l;turn();\u cbot/turn;\n;\norm; instruction.
* You can calculate relative distances and angles in order to get somewhere.
* You can use the documentation.
* You can prove why documentation is important and useful.
* You can learn new instructions by yourself.
* You can solve problems involving basic movement and geometry.
* You understand more math.
* You can program!

That's a lot, but you shouldn't stop here! It's just the beginning of the long journey of a programmer. In fact, this journey never ends, there's always more to learn, always new problems appear, always new technologies. But the more you know, the faster you learn, the more useful (and beautiful) things you can make.

In the next chapter, we'll move to the next level. We'll be learning some abstract concepts like variables and looping (they are what really make the programming powerful), so we'll be... drawing colorful images! It's not as easy (or boring) as it sounds, really!

But before we move on to the next chapter, here's the surprise...

\b;The Surprise
\c;
\tab;>>> WARNING! Enemy signatures detected nearby!
\tab;>>> WARNING! Enemy type: \l;AlienAnt\u object/ant;.
\tab;>>> WARNING! Enemies seem to be approaching this position!
\tab;>>> Searching for solutions...
\tab;>>> Solution found.
\tab;>>> Uploading SpecializedAntiAlienDefenseProgram to \l;WheeledShooter\u object/botfr;...
\tab;>>> Uploading canceled! The file is corrupted!
\n;
Yes, we've brought you to the same place as previously and aliens are attacking again. This time, it is \l;you\u object/human; who will write the program to defend yourself.

You can make Shooter shoot by using the \token;\c;\l;fire();\u cbot/fire;\n;\norm; instruction. \c;1\n; second of firing should be enough for each alien.
\c;
\tab;>>> CAUTION! Enemies are close!
\tab;>>> Position of the \l;WheeledShooter\u object/botfr; is sufficient for defense.
\tab;>>> 1 enemy detected 90 degrees to the left.
\tab;>>> 1 enemy detected 90 degrees to the right.
\tab;>>> 1 enemy detected 0 degrees to the left.
\tab;>>> No more enemies detected.
\n;
It seems that you are in a perfect position to shoot. You just need to turn around and shoot those hostile aliens. Have fun!

After you deal with them, you should take some break before moving on to the next chapter. When you sleep, the brain organizes your memory, so important information stays and unimportant is deleted. If you learn too much in a single day, some of the important information will be deleted or not as strongly saved in your memory as they should be! At least take an hour away from a computer and do something not related to sitting, looking at a display, reading, logical thinking and so on, to let some parts of your brain have a rest.

\b;Objective
Kill all the surrounding aliens and survive the ambush. Running away is prohibited under the threat of losing all the fun!

\t;Tip
The game world is paused while the editor or SatCom is opened, so you don't need to hurry.
