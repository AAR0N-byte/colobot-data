msgid "Experimenting is all fun and so on, but there is usually a place where you can find a lot of useful technical information. You should often look at documentation, especially if you're in doubt. Good programmers don't need to have an outstanding memory, they need to know how to search for information they seek and how to use it. You'll remember the details automatically anyway, if you use them often."

That's amazing, and surely you should feel amazing, even if you think you don't understand all that crazy stuff yet."

msgid "If you want to be a programmer, you need to be creative. Sure, there are a lot of tutorials out there, but they may not be of good quality, they might be outdated or just wrong. They are good for learning the basics, however, there is always time in the life's of a man when one wants to actually accomplish something. Like writing a program for a robot to fight real-life aliens. I'm pretty sure there are not tutorials for that (yet), but you never know when that skill might come in handy."

msgid "What can you do if there are no resources? Experiment! If you don't understand something fully, then give it a try. For example, what would happen if you gave the <code>Add</code> function letters instead of numbers? Does it work with fractions? Well, obviously you can't test that particular function since it exists only in our imagination, but you get the point. By experimenting you can discover new things and get more ideas how to use them for your purposes."

You'll find there almost everything what CBOT can do. You don't need to remember all this stuff, you just must know that it's there and that is the place where you should look first for an answer to your potential questions during coding. Even if they're like \"how to spell mov?\"."
