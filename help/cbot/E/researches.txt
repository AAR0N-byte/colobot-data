\b;Value \c;Research names\n;
Research names represent the types of available researches in the CBOT language. You can use them to control \l;ResearchCenter\u object\research; by passing them to appropriate instructions (e.g. \l;research\u cbot\research;, \l;canresearch\u cbot\canresearch;, \l;researched\u cbot\researched;).

In a program, research names are always displayed on a \const;red background\norm;. If a research name is not highlighted in red, it is misspelled. Caps and lower cases should be kept as is.

Below are the different research names available:

\c;\const;ResearchTracked\norm;       \n;Tracked bots (e.g. \l;tracked grabber\u object\botgc;)
\c;\const;ResearchWinged\norm;        \n;Winged bots (e.g. \l;winged grabber\u object\botgj;)
\c;\const;ResearchLegged\norm;        \n;Legged bots (e.g. \l;legged grabber\u object\botgs;)
\c;\const;ResearchShooter\norm;       \n;Bots with cannon (e.g. \l;tracked shooter\u object\botfc;)
\c;\const;ResearchOrgaShooter\norm;   \n;Bots with orgaball cannon (e.g. \l;tracked orga shooter\u object\botoc;)
\c;\const;ResearchPhazerShooter\norm; \n;\l;Phazer shooter\u object\botphaz;
\c;\const;ResearchSniffer\norm;       \n;Sniffers (e.g. \l;tracked sniffer\u object\botsc;)
